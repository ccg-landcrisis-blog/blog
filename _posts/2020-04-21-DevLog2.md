# Introduction

Yo! Dev Log #2 - I guess that means we are officially a series!

*Future Chris here: due to health issues this dev log came in a bit later than usual! Starting next week the devlogs will come in on monday, as most of the work happens during the weekends!*

A rather slow week this week, mostly due to work-work related troubles and hinderances, aswell as possible health impacts. But that doesn't mean stalling on LandCrisis! The other guys are effortlessly working on all kind activies around the project, promoting it, creating art, producing and sourcing audio and music for the game, etc. Gabriel usually keeps you posted on Twitter, Discord and Reddit regarding any progress we make on those fronts.

# Feedback

The feedback regarding the first devlog was actually pretty good - I'm glad that people like the format. If you got any more suggestions, questions or other comments make sure to drop a message on our discord server!

# Development progress

## current week

As discussed last week, we are finally closing in on an alpha build, some important things were finally imported, but sadly I have barely anything to show, as most of the progress looked like this:

The progress concluded the following topics:

* Moved all the units and buildings over to the new JSON and upgraded the last building and unit scripts to the new formats
* Rewrote the "Strategy Game" base object, which basically encapsulates buildings, units and resources.
* Finally, I was able to spawn objects again.
