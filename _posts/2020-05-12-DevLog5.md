# Introduction

Last time we fought the animators. This time we emerged victorious!

# Development progress

## current week

This week was rather quite due to day-job related hastles... but at least some things got pushed forward.

Summary:
* New Editor script to spawn player objects and quick reload features
* Added the new cursors
* Added basic attacking (for now everything just disappears after death)

![Editor script - whee.]({{ '/assets/images/0029-editor.png' | relative_url }})

![Attack inbound!]({{ '/assets/images/0028-editor.png' | relative_url }})

Since the basic structure now stands it should be far easier to implement the other missing states. The bulk of the work will be importing the sprites now, and additional game features, as well as the special flags for units (flying, swimming, stealing, ranged attacks, trebuchets, etc.).

But there's light at the end of the tunnel. The alpha is comming in big steps and we're eagerly awaiting it's arrival.
