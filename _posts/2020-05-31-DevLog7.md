# Introduction

The first internal build tests were started and Gab gave me a whole lot of points to fix, so let's get this party rollin'!

# Development progress

## 25. May - 31. May

The last week of may started with Gab pushing me for a (long overdue) build - and gave me intermediate report what's working and what's utterly broken. Turns out, some things seem to be broken despite we fixed them a couple of weeks ago.

So a quick summary of the current tasks:
* Implemented the new building system with "blue print" functionality (even with check for block or 'free')
* Revamped Bottom and Top UI elements to start reflecting the final version, and with that, revamped the task queue
* More JSON value fixes/changes due to requirements
* Trees can now have variations!
* Some menu navigation is broken, fixing this
* Extending the "Technology Tree" display to show units
* Quality of Life improvements ('warning splashscreen' whenever you change screens was removed to only be shown once)
* Added the new background soundtracks
