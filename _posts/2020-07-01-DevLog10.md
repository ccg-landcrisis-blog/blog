# Introduction

Builds 2 and 3 are up and running, moving onto new topics and fixing old topics.

# Development progress

## 22.6. - 1.7.

After taking a step back and having a bit more time after work helped getting things forward a bit.

A short breakdown:
* Tooltips on Buttons
* Build Buttons respond to available resources
* Another attempt to continue working on the map generation
* Implementing more rules according to the map generation specification document
* "Build" mechanics finished - You can now build buildings with villagers, collect resources, etc.
* "Attack" mechanics started - You can now attack enemies, they don't really react on it yet, and just take an axe to their head until they die, but yes, you can now axe your enemies
* Minimap Mechanics (click to move)

Bug Board: 14 Err, 4 In Progress, 32 Ready for testing!

1 or 2 more weeks... I really look forward to my vacation...
