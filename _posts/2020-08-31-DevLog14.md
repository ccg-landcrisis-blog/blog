# Introduction

My Lenovo Thinkpad X-something Yoga broke down right after the warrenty ended... (battery keeps discharging while connected, touchscreen broke, fingerprint reader broke like 1 month into me owning it) so much about being sturdy and top-of-the-market... so...

I got myself a new Lenovo Thinkpad E15 G2 AMD. For some reason this meme comes to mind...

# Development progress

## 22.8. - 31.8.

Mainly, I was waiting for my laptop to arrive, honestly.

After that, and setting up Unity and all the other required utils, I sat down and prepared stuff for the build, specifically:

- Ingame log display and Population display
- Technology Queue System
- Unity Build Queue System

Not much, honestly, but it cannot be helped, I had the option to work on a potato during this time, so Unity wasn't really an viable option here...


# Upcoming planned next steps

Holding my feet to the ground will be a *very* important thing in the next couple of days and weeks...
