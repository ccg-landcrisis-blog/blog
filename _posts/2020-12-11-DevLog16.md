# We are looking for a Unity Developer

For more information check out this reddit post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/irg3eb/revshare_c_developer_with_unity_experience_needed/)

# Introduction

Well, that was kind of an unneccessary and long silence from my side. What happened? Basically, alot went down on my private side. Tragedies, Near-Death stuff, emotional support stuff, as well as our 2nd big lock-down of our country, whee-hee. 
All this while working full time. Geez, guess it's no wonder this started to get on my mental health.

# Development progress

It has been *really* hard for me to get motivation to even start up Unity, let alone working on the game. There is still such a massive number of tasks missing, not much programming wise, but the frustation with Unity starts to get to me. 
The main goals right now is getting the unit placement and building placement properly working again, more on that in a bit.

## September

NightRaven did an absolute fantastic job on reworking the tiles, we did get ourselves into a bit of a pickle with trying to implement 3- and 4-way tiles meeting at the corners. I started implementing the system, but it still needs to get implemented into the main game, as there is some glue-logic involved...

## October

Redoing the minimap. We noticed that a 2nd live view of the entire map with... litterally 30-40 thousand trees is... not good. especially if we didn't somehow abstract them. I reimplemented the minimap into a more abstract version of itself, so it's now way faster and easier to handle. We do have problems with the map border now being a bit badly readable, but we are thinking of ways to improve that.

## November

I was mostly trying to get the new tiles in and banged my head against the wall with the existing system. At this point I'm considering dropping support for modability for a while until we have the basic version running. We also finally decided on the final tile sizes and implemented those accordingly.

## December (up to 11.)

Mostly handling private stuff and getting back on track. As there will be possibly lock-downs due to all the covid related issues and work being closed over the new-years I may have a chance to get back in on the game and get some progress done - I only hope that I can get myself motivated and off my own ass to actually do something.
NightRaven actually finished all of the units in their first pass, which makes me very happy (as he is progressing so fast) and incredibly sad (as the entire thing still is stuck on me). But, gotta suck it up, buttercup.

## Upcoming planned next steps

As there is no new developer in sight, the documentation is still a bit wonky, but I started to add comments and XMLDOC tags to the code, so we can actually create a documentation using Doxygen in C# now, which will help on-boarding quite a bit.

# Closing statement

Maybe I will change the development logs to a monthly format, right now I do not really feel the energy I get is best spent on writing dev logs, but rather should be invested in whatever little progress I can make on the game so the team is not held up.


Once again, stay safe, stay home and enjoy the christmas holidays,
